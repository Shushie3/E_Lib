The MNHS eLibrary is a simple yet functional web-based system that serves as a digital
library for Magarao National High School. It allows students to access, view, and download
learning resources in PDF format through the school’s local network.
Administrators or librarians can easily manage the collection by adding, updating, or
removing materials as needed.
